Case study: How does a bike-share navigate speedy success?

# Cyclist's Bike Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes bike-sharing data to uncover trends in user behavior, including differences between **casual riders** and **subscribers**. The analysis explores ride durations, peak usage times, and popular stations using **SQL, R, Python, and Advanced Excel**.

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset includes bike trip records with details such as:
- `trip_id`: Unique identifier for each ride.
- `start_time` & `end_time`: Timestamps for ride start and end.
- `tripduration`: Ride duration in seconds.
- `from_station_name` & `to_station_name`: Start and end station details.
- `usertype`: Identifies whether the rider is a **subscriber (member)** or a **casual rider**.
- `gender` & `birthyear`: Demographic details of riders.

## 🔍 Analysis Breakdown
### **1️⃣ SQL Analysis (BigQuery)**
- Data Cleaning: Removed duplicates and handled missing values.
- Aggregated ride trends by **day, month, and station popularity**.
- Identified the **most frequently used stations** and **peak riding hours**.

### **2️⃣ R Programming (RStudio)**
- Visualized ride trends using **ggplot2**.
- Compared **ride frequency by weekdays for members vs. casual users**.
- Analyzed **ride durations by user type**.

### **3️⃣ Python Analysis (Pandas & Matplotlib)**
- Conducted additional exploratory data analysis (EDA).
- Created **bar charts and heatmaps** to identify usage trends.
- Compared **subscriber vs. casual rides by month**.

### **4️⃣ Advanced Excel Analysis**
- Used **Pivot Tables & Charts** to summarize trip data.
- Conducted **trend analysis on monthly and daily ride patterns**.
- Applied **conditional formatting** to highlight key insights.

## 📊 Key Insights
- **Casual riders** prefer weekends, while **subscribers** ride consistently on weekdays.
- Peak riding times are **8 AM - 9 AM** (morning commute) and **5 PM - 7 PM** (evening commute).
- The most popular stations are **XYZ Station** and **ABC Station**.
